    <p>
        Rendering auditory data involves several approaches of sonification techniques that can be classified:

    </p>

    <P>
        <b>Auditory Icons and Earcons</b> are the most commonly found sonification techniques. Auditory icons imitate
        sounds from the real world to help the listener to infer information such as the sound of crunching paper when a
        user empties their trash on a computer. Earcons are similar but more abstract and do not resemble a
        sound-information relationship. Often, musical motifs are used and “high levels of recognition can be achieved
        by careful use of pitch, rhythm and timbre” \cite{Earcons}. To distinguish earcons from one another, clear
        differences between the sounds are required such as tonal, timbral, and temporal changes.

    </P>

    <p>
        <b>Audification</b> is the simplest technique that involves direct playback of data samples at a chosen
        frequency. Audio-signal processing techniques (such as filters, compression or frequency shifting) can be used
        to enhance the clarity of the audification. While simple, audification represents data accurately in its literal
        form. It is best suited for large orderable data sets. Hunt and Pauletto evaluated audification against visual
        displays in analysing helicopter flight data \cite{huntHeli}. The important attributes of the data were noise,
        repetition, frequency, discontinuity and signal power. It was found that there was a strong correlation between
        visual and audio display interpretation for the analysis of all 5 attributes.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Parameter Mapping</b> involves taking data with multiple dimensions and mapping the dimensions to different
        parameters of the sound. Common parameters used are frequency, amplitude, rhythm and timbre \cite{Kramer1994}.
        The advantage of parameter mapping over audification is that mappings are flexible and can allow for different
        aural views of a data set. However, parameter mapping can be sensitive and complex mappings can confuse a
        listener due to the non-linear relationships of sound parameters \cite{Worrall}. Therefore, it is often
        necessary to train listeners and an application such as proposed in this project is useful.


    </p>


    <p>
        <b>Model-based Sonification</b> uses acoustic models of real-world instruments, objects and spaces to explore
        data. With experience, humans can infer physical characteristics from everyday sounds such as material density,
        hardness and the shape of an object. All we require as a human is for there to be an excitation (pluck, blow,
        strike) against an object to produce the sound. There are two types of model-based sonification. The first is
        where parameters of a physical model are excited by the data and the second is where the resonator is created
        from the data itself and becomes the object that the user interacts with.
