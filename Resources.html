    <p>
        Over the last 25 years, plenty of excellent resources for learning and discovering sonification have been
        created. Here is a collation of the best resources.

    <p>
        <b>The Sonification Handbook</b> is a comprehensive introductory presentation of the key research areas in the
        interdisciplinary fields
        of sonification and auditory display. Chapters are written by leading experts, providing a wide-range coverage
        of the central issues, and can be read from start to finish, or dipped into as required (like a smorgasbord
        menu). Giving a solid introduction to the field of auditory display, the techniques for sonification, suitable
        technologies for developing sonification algorithms, and the most promising application areas. The book is
        accompanied by the online repository of sound examples.

    <p>
        <b>Sonification Design: From Data to Intelligible Soundfields</b> is about the contemporary design practice
        known as data sonification, which assists us to experience
        information by listening, much as we understand relationships between spatial features by viewing a graph of
        them. Data sonification begins with the observation that sounds can convey meanings in a multiplicity of
        circumstances: Exploring the structure of deep space, detecting a stock-market bubble, assisting injured
        patients to recover more quickly with less pain, monitoring the flow of traffic to help detect potential
        congestion, improving sporting perfor- mance, tracking storms, earthquakes and other changes in the environment
        ... and the list could go on: hundreds of applications that rely on studies in acoustics and psychoacoustics,
        philosophy of perception, cognitive psychology, computer sci- ence, creative auditory design and music
        composition.

    <br>

    <p><b>International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD)</b> is a forum and the main host of conferences where
        auditory displays are discussed. The yearly ICAD conference helps keep the community informed and up to date
        with current research. <a href="https://icad.org/announcements/">Available Here</a>
    </p>

    <p><b>Sonification.de</b> is a website created by Thomas Hermann dedicated to sonification. The site consists of
        some very useful links to interesting research. Most of the content is older and predates 2010. Most notably
        here are the links to Hermann’s own work in the field. <a href="https://sonification.de/">Available Here</a>
    </p>

    <p><b>Sonification.com</b> is a website created by Stephen Barrass. The website contains good links to some current
        research, otherwise is fairly barebones. Stephen offers sonification consultancy on here too. <a
                href="https://sonification.com/about/">Available Here</a>
    </p>

    <p><b>Wikipedia</b> has existed since 2004 and has been updated regularly to provide a good summary of the field. <a
